            Tips for Maintaining a Healthy Diet

Plan Meals Ahead: Plan meals ahead of time to ensure that you have healthy options available throughout the week. This can also help reduce the temptation to eat unhealthy fast food or processed snacks.

<p style="font-size: 25px;">Cook at Home: Cooking at home allows you to control the ingredients and portions of your meals, making it easier to maintain a healthy diet.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">Choose Whole Foods: Choose whole foods over processed foods, which are often high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">Hydrate: Drinking enough water is essential for overall health and can help reduce the risk of overeating or mistaking thirst for hunger.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">Practice Moderation: All foods can fit into a healthy diet in moderation. Allow yourself occasional indulgences while maintaining a balanced overall diet.</p>
